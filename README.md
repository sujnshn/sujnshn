# **👋 Hi, I'm Su Jin!**

🎓 **Senior at University of Virginia, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Religious Studies (Ethics & Buddhism)**

I love working on real-world problems using data analysis and predictive modeling. I'm always looking to build new skills and take on challenges, whether that’s learning a new tool or stepping up as a leader(Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as a [Break Through Tech Fellow.](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/)!) I have worked on! Lately, I’ve been focusing on machine learning and going deeper into data science. I’m hoping to find an internship where I can apply what I’ve learned, contribute to meaningful work, and learn from people in the field. If you have any relevant professional experience, I’d love to hear from you! (Fun fact: Furthermore, I have great respect for environmental sustainability, with an ambition to integrate this passion into tech solutions that can better our world. If any of these interest you, feel free to reach out so we can chat about it!)
